// Arithmetic Operations are the basic operations that can be performed on numbers in JS.

// There are mainly 6 types of Arithmetic Operations in JS:
// 1. Addition (+) - It is used to add two numbers in JS.
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);

// 2. Subtraction (-) - It is used to subtract two numbers in JS.
let num3 = 20;
let num4 = 10;
let sub = num3 - num4;
console.log(sub);

// 3. Multiplication (*) - It is used to multiply two numbers in JS.
let num5 = 10;
let num6 = 20;
let mul = num5 * num6;
console.log(mul);

// 4. Division (/) - It is used to divide two numbers in JS.
let num7 = 20;
let num8 = 10;
let div = num7 / num8;
console.log(div);

// 5. Modulus (%) - It is used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another number in JS.
let num9 = 20;
let num10 = 10;
let mod = num9 % num10;
console.log(mod);

// 6. Exponentiation (**) - It is used to raise one number to the power of another number in JS.
let num11 = 2;
let num12 = 3;
let exp = num11 ** num12;
console.log(exp);

// Output:
// 30
// 10
// 200
// 2
// 0
// 8
