// Comparison Operations are the operations that can be performed on numbers in JS to compare them means answer will be in boolean form (true or false).

// There are mainly 6 types of Comparison Operations in JS:
// 1. Greater Than (>) - It is used to check if one number is greater than another number in JS.
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let greaterThan = num1 > num2;
console.log(greaterThan);

// 2. Less Than (<) - It is used to check if one number is less than another number in JS.
let num3 = 20;
let num4 = 10;
let lessThan = num3 < num4;
console.log(lessThan);

// 3. Greater Than or Equal To (>=) - It is used to check if one number is greater than or equal to another number in JS.
let num5 = 10;
let num6 = 10;
let greaterThanOrEqualTo = num5 >= num6;
console.log(greaterThanOrEqualTo);

// 4. Less Than or Equal To (<=) - It is used to check if one number is less than or equal to another number in JS.
let num7 = 20;
let num8 = 10;
let lessThanOrEqualTo = num7 <= num8;
console.log(lessThanOrEqualTo);

// 5. Equal To (==) - It is used to check if one number is equal to another number in JS.
let num9 = 10;
let num10 = 10;
let equalTo = num9 == num10;
console.log(equalTo);

// 6. Not Equal To (!=) - It is used to check if one number is not equal to another number in JS.
let num11 = 10;
let num12 = 20;
let notEqualTo = num11 != num12;
console.log(notEqualTo);

// 7. Strict Equal To (===) - It is used to check if one number is strictly equal to another number in JS means it will check the value and type of the number in JS.
let num13 = 10;
let num14 = 10;
let strictEqualTo = num13 === num14;
console.log(strictEqualTo);

// 8. Strict Not Equal To (!==) - It is used to check if one number is strictly not equal to another number in JS means it will check the value and type of the number in JS.
let num15 = 10;
let num16 = 20;
let strictNotEqualTo = num15 !== num16;
console.log(strictNotEqualTo);
